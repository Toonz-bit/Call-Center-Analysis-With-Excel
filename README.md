### Project Overview

The Call Center Analysis project examines call data to evaluate key performance indicators such as call volume, response times, customer satisfaction, and agent efficiency. Using Excel, the project aims to uncover trends, identify areas for improvement, and support data-driven strategies to enhance customer service and operational effectiveness.

### Data Source

Data was given by the Company in excel format. I downloaded the csv file, and extracted it into Excel for cleaning, analysis and visualization. The data contains a sheet/table called Payment Table with 12,501 rows and 12 columns.

### Tools

- Excel - Data cleaning/Analysis/Visualizatio

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

 I cleaned the data efficiently and did some transformations with excel, Some of the applied steps include;

 - Making the clean data into a table format
 - Making first row has headers
 - Cleaning the data
 - Transferring the clean data into pivot table for visualization

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves exploring the call center data to answer key questions  such as ;

- Show Hour Students Requested Teachers Most
- Show Hour Classes Held Most
- Show Tutors Feedback Percentage
- Show Period of Day Request Came Most
- Show Number of Classes Taken By Tutors
- Show Request from Junior And Senior Class

### Data Analysis

 I did some analysis on pivot table before creating visuals, Analysis that were added are shown below;

### Results/Findings

Breakdown gives insight into common issues during classes, with "Other reasons" and "Student facing technical issues" being the most frequently reported categories. This data can help identify areas for improvement in classroom environments and technology reliability.

Senior classes have a higher proportion of requests, indicating they might have more needs or require additional support compared to junior classes. This insight could help in allocating resources effectively across different class levels.

### Recommendations

Resource Allocation: Allocate more resources, such as additional staff or time slots, to Senior classes to meet their higher demand. This could improve response times and overall service quality for these students.

Junior Class Engagement: Investigate whether Junior class students are receiving adequate support, as their lower request rate could indicate either fewer needs or potential underutilization of available resources.

### Limitations

Here are some limitations to consider with this analysis:

Lack of Detailed Data: The analysis only includes the count of requests without further details on the types or reasons for requests, which limits the ability to understand specific needs or issues faced by each class level.

Potential Bias in Request Rates: The lower request rate in Junior classes may not necessarily indicate fewer needs; it could reflect unawareness of available resources or reluctance to request help, which isn’t captured in the data.

No Temporal Analysis: The data lacks time-based information (e.g., trends over months), so it’s unclear if the request distribution is consistent or if certain times of the year see shifts in demand
